# Wasm Interface Type (WIT)

This is a repo that should be included as a [submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) to all FastEdge consuming projects. e.g. SDK's

This lets us to keep track of all history related to our WIT interface and will allow each consumer to stay tied to the version/commit they wish to consume.

To add it to your repo run:

```sh
git submodule add https://github.com/G-Core/FastEdge-wit.git <path>
```
